## What is beanstalkd?

It is a simple, fast work queue. Its interface is generic, but was originally designed for reducing the latency of page views in high-volume web applications by running time-consuming tasks asynchronously.

## How to use this image

### start a beanstalkd instance

```
$ docker run --name some-beanstalkd -d maateen/docker-beanstalkd
```

### start with persistent storage

```
$ docker run --name some-beanstalkd -v $(pwd):/var/cache/beanstalkd -d maateen/docker-beanstalkd
```

### exposing external port

```
$ docker run --name some-beanstalkd -d -p 11300:11300 maateen/docker-beanstalkd
```

## Environment Variables

### `PV_DIR`

Use a binlog to keep jobs on persistent storage in directory `PV_DIR`. Upon startup, **beanstalkd** will recover any binlog that is present in `PV_DIR`, then, during normal operation, append new jobs and changes in state to the binlog.

### `FSYNC_INTERVAL`

Call  [fsync](https://www.systutorials.com/docs/linux/man/2-fsync/)(2) at most once every  `FSYNC_INTERVAL`  milliseconds. Larger values for  `FSYNC_INTERVAL`  reduce disk activity and improve speed at the cost of safety. A power failure could result in the loss of up to  `FSYNC_INTERVAL`  milliseconds of history.

A  `FSYNC_INTERVAL`  value of 0 will cause  **beanstalkd**  to call fsync every time it writes to the binlog.

## Image Variants

The `beanstalkd` images come in many flavors, each designed for a specific use case.

###  `maateen/docker-beanstalkd:<beanstalkd_version>-alpine-<alpine_version>`

This image is based on the popular [Alpine Linux project](http://alpinelinux.org/), available in [the  `alpine`  official image](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine). Alpine Linux is much smaller than most distribution base images (~5MB), and thus leads to much slimmer images in general.

### Tagging confusion?

- `master` means the [master](https://github.com/beanstalkd/beanstalkd/tree/master) branch of **beanstalkd** project. New changes are always coming here, not so much stable.
- `alpine-edge` means current [development tree](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Aports_tree "Aports tree") of Alpine Linux. It consists of a APK repository called "edge" and contains the latest build of all available Alpine Linux packages. Those packages are updated on a regular basis. *"edge" is under constant development so be careful using it in production. It is possible that bugs in "edge" could cause data loss or could break your system.*
- `alpine-latest` means the [latest stable version](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Alpine_Linux:Releases) of Alpine Linux.
